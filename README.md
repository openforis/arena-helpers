# arena-helpers

arena-helpers is a collection of R Shiny applications for specific calculations and processing of forest monitoring sampling designs and field data.

They complement \[Openforis Arena\](<https://openforis.org/solutions/arena/>), the platform for data collection, storing and processing of forest inventories, field-based and most type of sampling based surveys.

All the applications are shipped as R packages. They can be used locally on user machines (R installation required and Rstudio recommended) or on the cloud (no installation required). R packages are also easier to maintain with function documentation and tests.
